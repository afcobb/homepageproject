<h3><b>A bit about me...</b></h3>
<br />
<body>
Since 2011, I've taught English and English as a Second Language at the undergraduate level, working on staff at both University of Cincinnati and Xavier University. I also work as a freelance copywriter and editor in sectors such as e-learning, retail, and PR. I own and curate an independent record label which publishes music, film, and literature and I produce music under my own name. Currently, I'm learning .net programming language in order to change paths to IT work.
